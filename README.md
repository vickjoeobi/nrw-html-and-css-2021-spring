# Welcome to HTML & CSS course of NRW (2021 Spring)

In this course we will learn how websites are made and teach you how to build your own.

Note this website uses Just The Docs, a well-known Jekyll theme, customized with ReDI colors and logos.

For instuctions and examples of what the theme can do, and how you can do the
same in your course pages, please see: https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs
